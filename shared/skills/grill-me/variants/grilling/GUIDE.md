## Odysseus execution profile: local, browser and Obsidian

This installation is configured for local execution. This profile narrows the
upstream workflows below and takes precedence over their optional online modes.
Use the current Nessy agent/model, local files, installed CLI tools and libraries.
Browser interaction and the local Obsidian integration are explicitly allowed.

- Do not request, configure or use extra API keys, cloud AI providers, hosted
  rendering, SaaS MCP connections or another agent runtime to complete this skill.
- Use local inputs, cached/bundled assets and installed local engines. When web
  content is necessary, use the host's browser tools; do not replace them with a
  provider API, authenticated scraping service or non-browser cloud connector.
- Select documented offline branches without waiting for cloud sign-in. Ignore
  upstream instructions to refresh skills remotely, log into a provider, generate
  media remotely, publish through a SaaS API, or invoke a removed skill.
- Use native host tools for browser control, subagents and language servers when
  available. A local LSP/MCP adapter is allowed; a foreign agent/plugin runtime is
  not a prerequisite to install. Report missing local capability honestly.
- If the requested output cannot be produced locally, explain the missing local
  input or tool. Do not silently switch to a cloud service or claim completion.
  Installing a skill does not install its local engines or dependencies.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Word each question so "yes" accepts your recommended answer.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
